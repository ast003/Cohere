These tasks include things like: * **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information. * **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions. * **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex situations. * **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information like images, sound, and text. * **Language understanding:** Processing and understanding human language. AI systems achieve these capabilities through various techniques, including: * **Machine learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming. This includes subfields like deep learning (using artificial neural networks with many layers) and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error). * **Natural language processing (NLP):** Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. * **Computer vision:** Enabling computers to "see" and interpret images and videos. * **Robotics:** Combining AI with physical robots to perform tasks in the real world. It's important to note that AI is not a single technology but a collection of techniques and approaches. The term "AI" is often used to describe systems that exhibit some level of intelligence, but the definition can be subjective and depends on the context. There's also a distinction between narrow or weak AI (designed for a specific task) and general or strong AI (hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks), with current AI systems largely falling into the narrow AI category.</span></p>
